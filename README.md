# VICEMUN conference site

This is a Next.js 16 conference site using Prisma, PostgreSQL, Google Sheets, and Resend.

## Conference setup

Conference-specific content is stored in [`config/conference.json`](C:/Desktop/vicemun/config/conference.json). For a new conference, update that file rather than searching the application source. It contains:

- conference name, dates, location, URL, SEO keywords, and organizer metadata
- the full color palette and asset paths
- enabled application types, card descriptions, and application images
- application labels, option lists, validation messages, committee choices, and separate `form.questions` sections for delegate, chair, delegation, press, and admin applications
- navigation, ordered `copy.letters.entries` content, footer, and page metadata copy

Committee and Secretariat content is database-backed and managed from `/admin`; it is intentionally not duplicated in JSON.

## Admin panel

After logging in at `/admin`, administrators can:

- create, edit, publish, order, and delete committees and Secretariat members
- edit conference names, dates, countdown start, hashtag, location, organizer details, and site URL
- edit each application card/form title and description
- enable or disable each application type; disabled types disappear from `/apply` and reject direct form/API requests
- edit the existing labels and prompts for every delegate, chair, delegation, press, and admin question
- set optional minimum word and character limits for questions; use `0` to leave a limit disabled
- add, edit, delete, and reorder multiple letters, each with its own title and content box

Conference settings are stored in the `ConferenceSettings` database table. If the table is unavailable, the site falls back to `config/conference.json`. Application questions are ordered arrays of explicit question objects with an `id`, label, type, required flag, placeholder, and dropdown options. The admin panel can add, remove, edit, and reorder supported question types without code changes.

## Environment variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in the values. It documents every variable used by the app without including secrets. `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` is the conference URL override; the default is the URL in `conference.json`. Set `GOOGLE_SITE_VERIFICATION` only when Google Search Console gives you a verification token for the deployment.

## Development

Install dependencies and run the development server with pnpm:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

Prisma is generated automatically by `postinstall`. Vercel can use `pnpm build`; an explicit `pnpm prisma generate && pnpm build` is also valid.

Before deploying, set the database, Resend, Google Sheets, and admin authentication variables in the hosting provider. Never commit `.env.local`.

Set the Resend sender address from `/admin` under Site Settings. New installations default to `onboarding@resend.dev`; replace it with an address on a domain verified in Resend before production email delivery.

For local application API testing, set `DISABLE_EMAIL_SENDING=true`. The API stores the verification code and logs it locally instead of sending through Resend. Remove the flag or set it to `false` before testing real email delivery or deploying.

After logging in at `/admin`, committees and Secretariat members, conference settings, application availability, form rules, application questions, and the letters page are managed from the same dashboard. Questions can be edited, added, or deleted per application type. The bottom of the Application Questions section also provides ordered, tab-separated Google Sheets headers ready to paste into cell `A1`. The image fields can upload PNG, JPG, WebP, and GIF files up to 10 MB directly to Vercel Blob; set `BLOB_STORE_ID` and `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` in `.env.local` and your deployment environment.

## Google Sheets headers

The application API writes columns in fixed orders. To create a sheet header quickly, copy one complete tab-separated line below and paste it into cell `A1` in the matching Google Sheet. Google Sheets will distribute the values across columns automatically.

### Delegate

```text
Full Name	Email Address	Phone Number	National ID	Birth Date	Gender	School Name	City	Grade/Level	English Level	1. Committee Choice	2. Committee Choice	3. Committee Choice	Experience	Motivation Letter	Dietary Preferences	Anything you would like to add?
```

### Chair

```text
Full Name	Email Address	Phone Number	National ID	Birth Date	Gender	School Name	City	Grade/Level	English Level	1. Committee Choice	2. Committee Choice	3. Committee Choice	Experience	Motivation Letter	GA Resolution Papers Question	Crisis Directive Question	Regular Committee Motions Question	Dietary Preferences	Anything you would like to add?
```

### Delegation

Delegation submissions write one summary row and then one row per delegate. The slash in this header separates the summary-row value from the delegate-row value for columns that share the same position. Paste this single line into `A1`.

```text
School or Organization / Delegate Full Name	Number of Delegates / Birth Date	Advisor/Delegation Email / National ID	Gender	1. Committee Choice	2. Committee Choice	3. Committee Choice	English Level	Dietary Preferences	Delegate Email	Delegate Phone	City	Grade/Level	Experience	Motivation Letter	Anything you would like to add?
```

### Press

```text
Full Name	Email Address	Phone Number	National ID	Birth Date	Gender	School Name	City	Grade/Level	Experience	Motivation Letter	Camera Model	Dietary Preferences	Anything you would like to add?
```

### Admin

```text
